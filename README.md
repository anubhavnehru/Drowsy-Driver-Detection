## Introduction
Welcome to the Drowsy Driver Detection Project. This repository hosts a machine learning-based solution aimed at detecting driver drowsiness in real-time. Our approach utilizes advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to analyze video data, thereby contributing to road safety by identifying early signs of driver fatigue.

## Project Overview
The project incorporates various CNN models such as VGG16, VGG19, and InceptionResNetV2, each rigorously trained and tested to ensure accuracy and reliability. These models work in tandem to process real-time video feeds, making the system robust in different driving conditions and lighting environments.

### Key Features
- Real-time detection of driver drowsiness.
- Integration of multiple CNN models.
- Comprehensive testing on diverse datasets.
- Detailed visualizations of model performances.
